This was a Word Search Game written in PostScript for my first year of study in Software Systems for the Arts and Media.

The project was completed in 1995 for my Computing and Representation class.

It was originally intended for use in the command line GhostScript Postscript interpreter for the PC, some features may not render correctly in other Post Script interpreters.

*How to Play*

The game displays a 5 x 5 grid of words, to play simply type a word you find on the grid in the interpreter.
